# Objective:

* The objective of this project is to build a neural network to classify handwritten digits using Tensorflow.

# Description:

* The images which I have worked on are black and white images of size 28 x 28 pixels, or 784 pixels total. 
* The features will be the pixel values for each pixel. Either the pixel is "white" (blank with a 0), or there is some pixel value.
* The goal to correctly predict what number is written down based solely on the image data in the form of an array.
